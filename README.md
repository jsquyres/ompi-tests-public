# Open MPI Public Tests Repo

This repository is a loose collection of tests used by the Open MPI
developer community.  Note that this repository, as a whole, is not a
production-quality, releasable software product intended for general
users.

That being said, individual test and/or test suites in this repository
may well be suitable for wider audiences.
